## Abstract
Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks enable the wireless communication network to sense the physical world, such as target positioning and tracking, environmental imaging and reconstruction, etc. The ISAC network is considered to be a key enabler of many future areas of next-generation communications, including but not limited to smart vehicle networks, smart homes and smart cities. Resource scheduling is crucial to the efficiency and quality of communication and sensing in an integrated communication and sensing system. The purpose of this thesis is to study the resource scheduling problem in ISAC systems. Firstly, this paper replicates and evaluates existing work for time resource scheduling in a multi-user time-division multiplexing ISAC system, and analyzes its communication throughput, sensing accuracy and effective throughput. This thesis further evaluates its advantages and disadvantages, and proposes improvement directions. In order to study the resource scheduling problem in ISAC system, this thesis designs a multi-user, multi-input and multi-output ISAC network resource scheduling system, using radar sensing combined with downlink communication. Spatial division multiplexing is adopted to improve the efficiency and performance of the system, In this thesis, we construct a power allocation problem in a multi-user spatial division multiplexing scenario based on proximal policy optimization (PPO), and propose a reasonable resource scheduling system design scheme. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the joint ISAC rate, communication sum-rate and radar information estimation sum-rate. The joint performance of sensing and communication of the proposed algorithm outperforms the fully-equal power allocation baseline algorithm by 5%~7% under three different scenario configurations.
